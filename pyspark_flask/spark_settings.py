Apache Spark can be used for handling a large number of concurrent connections by running the Flask application 
on a cluster and configuring the Spark context to use multiple worker nodes.

Here are the steps to configure Apache Spark for handling a large number of concurrent connections:

1. Create a Spark configuration with the following properties:

   ```python
   conf = SparkConf().setAppName("MyApp") \
                     .set("spark.executor.instances", "10") \
                     .set("spark.executor.cores", "2") \
                     .set("spark.executor.memory", "4g") \
                     .set("spark.driver.memory", "4g")
   ```

   This configuration sets the number of executor instances to 10, each with 2 cores and 4 GB of memory. 
  It also sets the driver memory to 4 GB.

2. Create a Spark context using the configuration:

   ```python
   sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)
   ```

3. Run the Flask application using the `spark-submit` command:

   ```bash
   $ spark-submit --master spark://<master-node>:7077 app.py
   ```

   This command starts the Flask application on the Spark cluster.

4. Configure the load balancer to distribute requests across the worker nodes. 
This can be done using tools such as HAProxy or Apache HTTP Server.

With this setup, the Spark cluster can handle 
a large number of concurrent connections by distributing the load across multiple worker nodes. 
Note that the exact configuration settings may need to be adjusted based on 
the specific requirements of the application and the available resources in the cluster.
