Sure, you can add a phone number and password field to the `MyForm` class as follows:

```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField, PasswordField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, Optional

class MyForm(FlaskForm):
    name = StringField('Name', validators=[DataRequired()])
    email = StringField('Email', validators=[DataRequired()])
    phone = StringField('Phone Number', validators=[Optional()])
    password = PasswordField('Password', validators=[DataRequired()])
    submit = SubmitField('Submit')
```

In this modified version of `MyForm`, we have added two new fields - `phone` and `password`. The `phone` field has been marked as optional, so it won't be required when the form is submitted. The `password` field is required, and we have used the `PasswordField` class to ensure that the password is not visible as plain text when entered.

You can then use these fields in your Flask app's route as follows:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from forms import MyForm

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    form = MyForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        name = form.name.data
        email = form.email.data
        phone = form.phone.data
        password = form.password.data
        # Do something with the data
        return 'Success!'
    return render_template('index.html', form=form)
```

In this example, we have added two new variables `phone` and `password` to retrieve the data entered by the user in the corresponding form fields. Note that we have also updated the `if` statement to use `validate_on_submit()` instead of `is_submitted()` to ensure that all required fields have been filled out before processing the form.

You can then update your template to include the new form fields as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Form</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Form</h1>
    <form method="POST">
        {{ form.csrf_token }}
        <div>
            {{ form.name.label }}
            {{ form.name() }}
        </div>
        <div>
            {{ form.email.label }}
            {{ form.email() }}
        </div>
        <div>
            {{ form.phone.label }}
            {{ form.phone() }}
        </div>
        <div>
            {{ form.password.label }}
            {{ form.password() }}
        </div>
        {{ form.submit() }}
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Here, we have added two new `div` elements to render the `phone` and `password` fields. 
Note that the `phone` field will only be rendered if it has been added to the form.
