You are correct, I apologize for my mistake. Here is an updated example of how 
to set up an admin dashboard blueprint with a URL prefix and a login required decorator in a separate file and 
then import it in the `routes.py` file to register the blueprint:

First, create a new file called `admin.py` and define the admin dashboard routes under an `admin_bp` blueprint:

```python
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, redirect, url_for, session
from functools import wraps

# Create the admin blueprint with a URL prefix of '/admin'
admin_bp = Blueprint('admin', __name__, url_prefix='/admin')

# Define a login_required decorator to protect admin routes
def login_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if not session.get('logged_in'):
            return redirect(url_for('login'))
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function

# Define the admin dashboard route
@admin_bp.route('/dashboard')
@login_required
def dashboard():
    return render_template('admin/dashboard.html')
```

In this file, we define the `admin_bp` blueprint with a URL prefix of `/admin`, and we define a `login_required` decorator 
to protect the admin routes. We then define the `dashboard` route under the `admin_bp` blueprint, 
which requires the `login_required` decorator to ensure that only authenticated users can access the dashboard.

Next, in the `routes.py` file, we can import the `admin_bp` blueprint from the `admin.py` file and register it in the Flask app:

```python
from flask import Flask
from admin import admin_bp

app = Flask(__name__)

# Register the admin blueprint in the Flask app
app.register_blueprint(admin_bp)
```

Here, we import the `Flask` class from Flask, and we import the `admin_bp` blueprint from the `admin.py` file. 
We then create a new instance of the `Flask` class and register the `admin_bp` blueprint in the Flask app using the `app.register_blueprint` method.

With this setup, any routes registered under the `admin_bp` blueprint (in this case, just the `/dashboard` route) will be protected by the `login_required` decorator, 
and will only be accessible to authenticated users.
