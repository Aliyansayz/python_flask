Sure, here's an updated version of the code that also saves the session ID in a JSON document for today's date:

```python
import json
import uuid
from datetime import date
from flask import session, request

@app.before_request
def assign_session_id():
    # Check if user already has a session ID
    if 'session_id' not in session:
        # Generate a unique session ID
        session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        # Load the existing session IDs from the JSON file
        with open('session_ids.json', 'r') as f:
            session_ids = json.load(f)
        # Check if the generated session ID is already in use
        while session_id in session_ids:
            session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        # Add the new session ID to the list of existing session IDs
        session_ids.append(session_id)
        # Save the updated session IDs to the JSON file
        with open('session_ids.json', 'w') as f:
            json.dump(session_ids, f)
        # Assign the session ID to the user's session
        session['session_id'] = session_id

        # Set the session cookie to be secure and HttpOnly
        session.permanent = True
        session.permanent_session_lifetime = timedelta(days=30)
        session.cookie_secure = request.is_secure
        session.cookie_httponly = True

        # Save the session ID in a JSON document for today's date
        today = date.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        with open(f'session_ids_{today}.json', 'r+') as f:
            session_ids_today = json.load(f)
            session_ids_today.append(session_id)
            # Prevent duplicate session IDs in the same document
            session_ids_today = list(set(session_ids_today))
            f.seek(0)
            json.dump(session_ids_today, f)
```

Here's what we changed:

- We imported the `date` object from the `datetime` module, so that we can get today's date and use it to save the session ID in a JSON document for today's date.
- We added several lines to save the session ID in a JSON document for today's date:
  - `today` is set to today's date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  - We open the JSON document for today's date using the `r+` mode, which allows us to read and write to the file.
  - We load the existing session IDs from the JSON document.
  - We append the new session ID to the list of existing session IDs.
  - We use `set()` to remove any duplicates from the list of session IDs (in case the same user visits the site multiple times in the same day).
  - We write the updated list of session IDs back to the JSON document.
