Python Flask is a popular web framework for building web applications. 
It includes support for handling cookies, which are small pieces of data stored on the client-side.
To work with cookies in Flask, you can use the `request` and `response` objects provided by Flask. 
Here's a basic example of setting and accessing cookies:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Set a cookie
    response = make_response('Cookie set!')
    response.set_cookie('username', 'John Doe')
    return response

@app.route('/profile')
def profile():
    # Access the cookie
    username = request.cookies.get('username')
    return f'Hello, {username}!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this example, the `/` route sets a cookie named "username" with the value "John Doe". 
The `/profile` route then retrieves the value of the "username" cookie and displays a personalized message.

Note that cookies can also have additional options such as expiration time, domain, and secure flag. 
You can pass these options as parameters to the `set_cookie` method.
