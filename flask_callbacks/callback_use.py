A practical example of using a callback function in Flask is in the context of handling asynchronous operations or events that occur in your application. Here's an example:

Suppose you have a Flask web application that interacts with an external API to fetch some data. 
However, the API request takes some time to complete, and you don't want to block the user's request while waiting for the response. 
In this case, you can use a callback function to handle the API response asynchronously.

Here's a simplified example:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

def process_api_response(response):
    # This is the callback function that will be executed when the API response is received
    # You can perform further processing or handle the response as needed
    print(response.json())

@app.route('/fetch_data')
def fetch_data():
    # Perform an API request asynchronously
    api_url = 'https://api.example.com/data'
    requests.get(api_url, callback=process_api_response)
    
    # Return an immediate response to the user
    return 'Fetching data...'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this example, when a user accesses the `/fetch_data` endpoint in the Flask application, it triggers an asynchronous API request using the `requests` library. 
The `requests.get()` function is used with an additional `callback` parameter, which accepts the callback function `process_api_response` as an argument.

The `process_api_response` function defines the logic to be executed when the API response is received. 
In this example, it simply prints the JSON response, but you can perform any required processing or data manipulation.

By using a callback function, the Flask application can continue executing and return an immediate response to the user while waiting for the API response. 
Once the API response is received, the callback function is triggered, allowing you to handle the response asynchronously.

Note that the `requests` library used in this example doesn't natively support callbacks. 
You may need to use a different library or implement a custom solution to enable callback functionality. 
The example above is provided for illustrative purposes to demonstrate how you can integrate a callback function into a Flask application.
