To modify the YAML structure and Python script to include additional fields in the 'companies' and 'products' tables, follow these steps:

Step 1: Update the YAML Structure
Edit the YAML file (`b2b_schema.yaml`) and add the new fields for 'companies' and 'products'. Here's the updated structure:

```yaml
tables:
  - name: users
    columns:
      - name: id
        type: INTEGER
        constraints: PRIMARY KEY
      - name: name
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: email
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL UNIQUE
      - name: password
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL

  - name: companies
    columns:
      - name: id
        type: INTEGER
        constraints: PRIMARY KEY
      - name: name
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: email
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL UNIQUE
      - name: address
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: phone
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: website
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL

  - name: products
    columns:
      - name: id
        type: INTEGER
        constraints: PRIMARY KEY
      - name: name
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: description
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: price
        type: REAL
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: category
        type: TEXT
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: lower_markup_price
        type: REAL
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: higher_markup_price
        type: REAL
        constraints: NOT NULL
      - name: company_id
        type: INTEGER
        constraints: NOT NULL,
        references: companies(id)
```

In the 'companies' table, the 'email' field has been added.

In the 'products' table, the 'category', 'lower_markup_price', and 'higher_markup_price' fields have been added.

Step 2: Update the Python Script
Modify the Python script to create the tables with the new fields. Here's the updated code:

```python
import sqlite3
import yaml

def create_tables(database_path, yaml_path):
    # Load the YAML file
    with open(yaml_path, 'r') as file:
        schema = yaml.safe_load(file)

    # Connect to the SQLite database
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Create tables
    for table in schema['tables']:
        table_name = table['name']
        columns = table['columns']
        column_definitions = ', '.join([f"{col['name']} {col['type']} {col.get('constraints', '')}" for col in columns])
        cursor.execute(f"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table_name} ({column_definitions})")

    # Commit the changes and close the connection
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Usage
database_path = 'b2b_database.db'
yaml_path = 'b2b_schema.yaml'
create_tables(database_path, yaml_path)
```

This code will now create the 'companies' table with the 'email' field and the 'products' table with the 'category', 'lower_markup_price', and 'higher_markup_price' fields.

Make sure to update the `database_path` and `yaml_path` variables with the appropriate paths.

By running this script, the SQLite database will be updated with the new fields in the
