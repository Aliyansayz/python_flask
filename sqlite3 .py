"""
Sure, here's an example Python code that uses SQLite3 to group 
a car dataset by brand name and price to calculate the average price, and 
then group it by vehicle type to calculate the count of sales:
"""

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('car_data.db')

# Create a cursor object
c = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query to calculate the average price of each brand
c.execute("SELECT brand, AVG(price) FROM cars GROUP BY brand")

# Fetch the results
rows = c.fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Execute a query to calculate the count of sales for each vehicle type
c.execute("SELECT vehicle_type, COUNT(*) FROM cars GROUP BY vehicle_type")

# Fetch the results
rows = c.fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and the connection
c.close()
conn.close()
```
"""
In this example, we first execute a SELECT query to group the 'cars' table by brand name and 
calculate the average price for each brand using the AVG() function. 
We then fetch the results and print them to the console.

Next, we execute a second SELECT query to group the 'cars' table by vehicle type and 
calculate the count of sales for each vehicle type using the COUNT() function. 
We fetch the results and print them to the console as well.

Finally, we close the cursor and connection to the database. 

Note: You may need to modify the table and column names in the queries to match your specific use case. """
