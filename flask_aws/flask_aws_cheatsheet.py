Sure! Here's a cheat sheet for using Flask with AWS:

1. Set up an AWS account:
   - Go to the AWS website (https://aws.amazon.com/) and create an account if you don't have one already.
   - Set up your AWS credentials, which include an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key.

2. Launch an EC2 instance:
   - Go to the EC2 service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Launch a new EC2 instance, choosing the desired instance type and other configurations.
   - Configure security groups to allow inbound traffic to your Flask application (e.g., HTTP on port 80 or HTTPS on port 443).

3. Connect to your EC2 instance:
   - Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance using the key pair associated with the instance.

4. Set up your Flask application:
   - Install Flask on your EC2 instance by running `pip install flask`.
   - Write your Flask application code and save it in a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).

5. Run your Flask application:
   - Start your Flask application by running `python app.py`.
   - Ensure that your Flask application is accessible on the specified port (e.g., port 80).

6. Set up a domain name (optional):
   - Register a domain name through a registrar of your choice (e.g., Route 53 in AWS).
   - Configure DNS settings to point your domain name to your EC2 instance's public IP address.

7. Set up a load balancer (optional):
   - Go to the EC2 service and create a load balancer.
   - Configure the load balancer to distribute traffic to your EC2 instances running the Flask application.

8. Set up HTTPS (optional):
   - Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain (e.g., using AWS Certificate Manager or a third-party provider).
   - Configure the load balancer or the Flask application to use HTTPS.

9. Set up a database (optional):
   - Use AWS services like RDS (Relational Database Service) or DynamoDB to set up a database for your Flask application.
   - Configure your Flask application to connect to the database.

10. Set up other AWS services (optional):
    - Explore other AWS services like S3 for file storage, SES for sending emails, or SNS for push notifications, and integrate them with your Flask application as needed.

Remember, this cheat sheet provides a high-level overview, and you may need to refer to the official documentation of Flask and 
AWS services for more detailed instructions.
