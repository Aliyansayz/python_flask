Here is an SQL cheat sheet for an intermediate Python Flask backend developer:

### CREATE TABLE

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype
);
```

### INSERT INTO

```SQL
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```

### SELECT

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name;
```

### WHERE

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### UPDATE

```SQL
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = new_value WHERE condition;
```

### DELETE

```SQL
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### ORDER BY

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC/DESC;
```

### GROUP BY

```SQL
SELECT column1, AVG(column2), COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;
```

### JOIN

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column1;
```

### LIMIT

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name LIMIT 10;
```

### ALTER TABLE

```SQL
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name datatype;
```

### DROP TABLE

```SQL
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

These are some of the most commonly used SQL statements that 
you may need to use in your Python Flask backend development work. 
Remember to always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks, 
and to test your queries thoroughly before deploying them to production.
