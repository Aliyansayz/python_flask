You are correct. I apologize for the confusion. In my previous response, I provided an example HTML template that shows how to display the uploaded images using a loop that iterates over the images in the `images` JSON object. However, I forgot to include the step where the `images` JSON object is passed to the HTML template using the `render_template` function.

To fix this, you can modify the `/` route to read the `images` JSON object from disk and pass it to the HTML template as a variable. Here's an updated example that includes this step:

```
import os
import json
from flask import Flask, render_template, send_file, request, redirect, url_for
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define the maximum file size (in bytes)
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 7 * 1024 * 1024

# Define the allowed file extensions
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'.jpg', '.png'}

# Define the path to the uploads directory
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'

# Set the configuration options for the Flask app
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = MAX_FILE_SIZE

# Define a function to check if a file has an allowed extension
def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

# Define the route for the homepage
@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Read the JSON file containing information about uploaded images
    with open('images.json', 'r') as f:
        images = json.load(f)
    
    # Pass the images variable to the HTML template
    return render_template('index.html', images=images)

# Define the route to handle file uploads
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    # Check if a file was uploaded
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return 'No file uploaded', 400
    
    file = request.files['file']

    # Check if the file is an allowed format (jpg, png)
    if not allowed_file(file.filename):
        return 'Invalid file format', 400

    # Save the file to the uploads directory
    filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
    file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))

    # Add information about the uploaded image to the JSON document
    with open('images.json', 'r') as f:
        images = json.load(f)
    images['images'].append({
        'filename': filename,
        'url': f'/uploads/{filename}'
    })
    with open('images.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(images, f)

    return redirect(url_for('index'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this updated code, the `index` route now reads the `images` JSON object from the `images.json` file and 
passes it to the `index.html` template using the `render_template` function. 
The `images` variable is then available in the HTML template, 
so you can use the loop to iterate over the images and display them using `<img>` tags.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Upload a file</h2>
    <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="file" accept=".jpg, .png" required>
      <br><br>
      <input type="submit" value="Upload">
    </form>
    
    <h2>Download images</h2>
    {% for image in images['images'] %}
      <img src="{{ image['url'] }}" alt="{{ image['filename'] }}" style="max-width: 200px; max-height: 200px;">
      <br>
      <a href="{{ image['url'] }}" download>Download {{ image['filename'] }}</a>
      <br><br>
    {% endfor %}
  </body>
</html>
